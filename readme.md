## Setup

You need to create a "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" which has to be done with a Google Workspace (gsuite). This will not work on a personal gmail account (unless you create a app on a workspace and add your personal account as a test account).

### Generating a Gmail API Token

1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console. https://console.developers.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Go to "APIs & Services" -> "Library" and enable the Gmail API.
4. Navigate to "APIs & Services" -> "Credentials".
5. Click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID".
6. Select "Desktop app" as the application type, then click "Create".
7. Download the JSON file, rename it to `credentials.json`, and place it in the root of this project.
8. Run the script and oauth into your account

If you want to edit scopes on an existing application, you can:

1. OAuth Consent Screen
2. Edit
3. Continue to step 2
4. Add or remove scopes
5. Add scopes and save

#### Credential Scopes Needed

Two main scopes are required for this:

* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`

Some other scopes I'd add so you can reuse the credentials in other projects, [like gmailctl](https://github.com/mbrt/gmailctl) or calendar scripts:

* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.event`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic`
